# Image-Classification
Dogs vs Cats app Using Deep Learning - CNN from Canvas build on tkinter- GUI

# Requirements

* Python 3.5 +
* Numpy (+ mkl for Windows)
* PIL ( pillow )
* Opencv
* Keras ( Tensorflow as backend )
* tkinter ( python GUI )

# About Project
* Trained model on dogs_vs_cats dataset Using CNN (Convolutional Nueral Network)

* Save model as 'cats_and_dogs_small_2.h5' ( train_digit_recognizer.py )

* Using tkinter GUI make a canvas and classify image on it

* Use saved model 'cats_and_dogs_small_2.h5' to predict saved dogs vs cats classification image from canvas
